General
-------

next is a small tool that helps you manage your tv-show watching habits.
It keeps a local sqlite database holding information about shows you watch
and which season and ep you're currently at. It allows you to play an ep
of a show of your choice, or just starts up a random ep. next features a
fully functional TUI to manage your local database.

Requirements
------------

next itself uses basic python and should work in python 2.6 and above. 

To be able to play video from the command line a command line video player
is required. I myself use mplayer but since you specify your own 
command line to start video's with (see Configuration), you can use
whatever you want!

Because next uses the TVRage database to retrieve show information you need to
install the tvrage python module. The easiest way to install this module is
using the python-pip package:

    user@box$ sudo pip install python-tvrage

Other methods can be found on pypi:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-tvrage/0.1.4

For the configuration and database files next can use the XDG Base Directory 
Specification (see http://bit.ly/tulYTA). This needs the package 
python-xdgapp to be installed, you can probably find this in your distro's 
repository somewhere. pip may also have python-xdgapp although this was not the
case when I checked it last time. You can try using:

    user@box$ sudo pip install python-xdgapp

If you run next under Windows installing python-xdgapp is quite useless, next
will default to ~/.next/next.conf for the configuration file and to the show dir
specified in the configuration file for the database.


Installation
------------

First of all, make sure you've read the Requirements section above to make sure
you have all the right libraries.

Since next is just a small python script, installing it is really easy.
Just checkout the source somewhere (we'll use ~/src/ as an example) and
put next.py in your path:

    user@box$ git clone git://github.com/Sakartu/next.git src/next
    user@box$ sudo ln -s ~/src/next/next.py /usr/bin/next

After this next will be at your disposal from your terminal. That's all the
installation that's required :)

Configuration
-------------

Out of the box next will use the XDG Base Directory specification (see
http://bit.ly/tulYTA) to find it's configuration file and database. If the XDG 
Base Directory isn't available next will default to ~/.next/next.conf for the
configuration file. If no alternate path is specified in the configuration file
next will default to the specified show_path.

If you want you can put the configuration elsewhere, just use the -c flag to
specify another location. In the configuration file there are a few options that
we'll discuss below:

Option | Explanation | Optional? | Default
-------|-------------|-----------|--------
player_cmd | This is the command line that next will use to start an episode | no | totem
database_path | If you want your database to reside somewhere other than the default, you can specify it here | yes | ~/downloads/series
show_path | This is your series directory, something like ~/downloads/series/ | no | ~/downloads/series/
unstructured_mode | Set this option to True if you have all your eps (from every show) in a single download dir | yes | False
post_hook | A comma-separated list of scripts to call after an ep is watched. See the config file for possible parameters. | yes | /bin/rm {path}
length_detection | The number of minutes you have to watch an ep before next will ask you to update the database. | yes | 0
ask_another | Set this option to false if you don't want next to ask to play another ep | yes | True

There is a documented example configuration file in the repository in the config/
dir. A default configuration file will also be generated if no file can be
found.

TUI manual
----------

The TUI functions have their own documentation. If you start the TUI and type
help <command> you can learn some more about a command.

Completion
----------

next also features bash commandline completion. This will complete the names of your
shows when next is used directly from your terminal, without the TUI. For instance, 
to play the next ep of the show "White Collar", just execute the following command:

    user@box$ next white

If you press <tab> just after typing "wh" it will complete to white for you. 
The completion file found in ./completion/ can be put in /etc/bash_completion.d/
to provide tab completion for your shows. 

If you want to enable the completion features right away, just use the following 
commands:

    user@box$ sudo cp ~/src/next/completion/next /etc/bash_completion.d/
    user@box$ . /etc/bash_completion.d/next
    
The last command will "source" the completion file to enable it immediately.

next features fuzzy show name matching, meaning that if you have no other shows 
that have the letters "wh" in them, in that order, typing

    user@box$ next wh
    
is enough to start the next "White Collar" ep.

Usage
-----

Some basic usage has already been discussed in the previous sections. Here follows
a more complete guide.

The first thing you need to do is add a show to the database. Adding a show looks 
up the show by name in the (remote) TVRage database and adds all the
information it can find to the local database. The internal episode cache gets
updated as you watch but you can update the cache manually (if, for instance,
you almost always watch in an offline setting) using the -u flag. Make sure the
cache gets updated regularly, otherwise next won't know what to do with new eps
as they come out! Playing a show has already been covered in the bash completion
part above.

next will look for eps for your shows in the given location in the configuration 
file. If, for some reason, you have the eps for a specific show in another location
you can add this manually by using the "--add_location" (CLI) or "add_location" 
(TUI) commands.

A final feature worth mentioning is the scan option. The first time you start next, 
after configuring it's options in the config file, you can use the "--scan" (CLI)
or "scan" (TUI) command to scan the specified show path for shows and add them
to the database. This will take you through a wizard to add shows and specify what
ep you are in what season.
