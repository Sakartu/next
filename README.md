next is a small tool that helps you manage your tv-show watching habits.
It keeps a local sqlite database holding information about shows you watch
and which season and ep you're currently at. It allows you to play an ep
of a show of your choice, or just starts up a random ep. next features a
fully functional TUI to manage your local database.
