# a comma-separated list of scripts to call after an ep is watched and the
# database is updated. The script will be called always when the database is
# updated. The arguments for the script can be the following:
# 'status'          The status of the show (Returning, Cancelled, etc) 
# 'name'            The name of the show
# 'season'          The season of the watched ep
# 'ep'              The episode number of the watched ep
# 'sid'             The TVRage show id
# 'path'            The absolute path to the watched ep
#
# They should be placed in curly braces. For example:
# post_hook=~/bin/test.py {path} {season} {ep}
# multiple scripts can be called by separating them with comma's:
# post_hook=~/bin/test.py {path},~/bin/test2.py {season} {ep}
# 
# The example below will delete the watched ep after a succesful watch.
#post_hook=/bin/rm {path}

# Number of minutes an ep should be playing before next asks all the post-watch
# questions (database update, etc). If set to 0 or commented out, next will
# always ask the post-watch questions.
